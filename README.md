# IRTF_SUSTAIN_RG
Working space for developing the draft charter of the proposed IRTF Sustainability and the Internet Research Group (SUSTAIN RG).

At IETF 121 in Dublin, Ali Rezaki and Eve Schooler are holding a Public Side Meeting to present a draft charter for a proposed IRTF Sustainability and the Internet Research Group (SUSTAIN RG). The draft charter document will be shared here well in advance of the side meeting date, as well as in the E-impact and green-wg mailing lists to ensure ample dicussion prior to the side meeting. 
We are aware that the side meeting is difficult to attend remotely. Accordingly, we will arrange an additional on-line meeting about a week after the IETF 121 to ensure participation from remote participants as well.
Thanks very much for your interest and contribution.
